`even_odd.py` runs a simulation for optimal player 1 strategy on the _even-odd game_ detailed on pg. 5

`saddle_point.py` computes the saddle for a game matrix with example matrices from pgs 8, 9

`2x2.py` implements optimal strategy for determining `p, q, v` for a 2x2 game matrix using saddle point detection and the formulas from pgs 9. 10
